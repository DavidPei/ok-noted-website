## üéØ Major Achievement: Screenshot Section Transformation

### Before: Static 2x2 Grid
- **Problem**: Static grid layout didn't showcase the extension's dynamic workflow
- **User Experience**: Passive viewing of disconnected screenshots
- **Engagement**: Low - users couldn't understand the flow or interact meaningfully

### After: Interactive Progressive Reveal
- **Solution**: 3-step workflow with emoji navigation (üé• Watch ‚Üí üìù Note ‚Üí ‚òÅÔ∏è Sync)
- **User Experience**: Interactive storytelling that guides users through the actual usage flow
- **Engagement**: High - users can click through steps, see auto-advance, and view full-size images

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### HTML Structure Changes
- **Removed**: Static 2x2 screenshot grid
- **Added**: Progressive reveal with step navigation above screenshots
- **Simplified**: From 4 steps to 3 for cleaner user journey
- **Enhanced**: Modal lightbox with keyboard navigation support

### CSS Improvements
```css
/* Enhanced step navigation visibility */
.step-nav {
    background: var(--gray-100);           /* More prominent than previous --bg-light */
    border: 2px solid var(--gray-300);    /* Stronger border */
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); /* Added depth */
}

.step-nav:hover {
    background: var(--primary-light);     /* Bold blue background */
    color: white;                         /* White text for contrast */
    transform: translateY(-2px);          /* Lift effect */
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(6, 95, 212, 0.25); /* Enhanced shadow */
}

.step-emoji {
    font-size: 1.5rem;                    /* Prominent emoji size */
    filter: grayscale(20%);               /* Subtle muting for inactive */
}

.step-nav.active .step-emoji,
.step-nav:hover .step-emoji {
    filter: none;                         /* Full color for active/hover */
    transform: scale(1.1);                /* Slight enlargement */
}
```

### JavaScript Functionality

## üéØ FAQ Section Icon Centering Fix (2025-08-20)

### Problem Solved
**Issue**: Plus (+) and minus (-) icons in FAQ section were misaligned within their circular backgrounds
- Icons appeared "too high" and "too small"
- Inconsistent across browsers and screen sizes
- Created unprofessional appearance

### Technical Challenge
Multiple CSS approaches failed due to font baseline metrics:
1. **Flexbox centering**: Didn't account for character positioning
2. **CSS Grid baseline**: Conflicts with `<summary>` element behavior  
3. **Line-height matching**: Font metrics still caused visual misalignment
4. **Standard centering**: Mathematical centering ‚â† visual centering for text characters

### Solution Implemented
**CSS Grid + Transform Compensation**:
```css
.faq-grid summary::after {
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    font-size: 16px;              /* Increased from 14px */
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    transform: translateY(-0.5px); /* Baseline compensation */
}
```

### Key Improvements
- **Visual Centering**: Perfect alignment both horizontally and vertically
- **Optimal Font Sizes**: 16px/15px/14px across desktop/tablet/mobile
- **Cross-Browser Consistency**: Works identically across all browsers
- **Responsive Scaling**: Proportional adjustments for different circle sizes

### Technical Implementation
- **Files Modified**: `css/style.css` (lines 1679-1722, responsive breakpoints)
- **HTML Updates**: Added `<span class="summary-text">` wrappers for proper layout
- **Alternative Methods**: 5 fallback approaches documented in CSS comments
- **Testing**: Validated across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

### User Experience Impact
- **Professional Appearance**: Perfectly aligned icons enhance visual credibility
- **Better Readability**: Larger, clearly visible icons
- **Trust Building**: Attention to detail builds user confidence
- **Consistency**: Uniform experience across all devices

### Documentation Created
- **Detailed Technical Doc**: `faq-icon-centering-fix.md` with complete implementation details
- **Alternative Solutions**: Multiple fallback methods for future reference
- **Maintenance Notes**: Guidelines for future font or design changes
