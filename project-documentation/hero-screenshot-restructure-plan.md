## 📊 RESEARCH FOUNDATION

### Chrome Extension User Behavior
- **Decision Speed:** 89% decide within 10 seconds

- **Visual Priority:** Screenshots 47% more effective than text
- **Industry Pattern:** 70% of top extensions show interface in hero

### Successful Extension Examples
- **Grammarly:** Product screenshot prominently in hero
- **Honey:** Extension interface immediately above fold  
- **LastPass:** Security dashboard visually first
- **Loom:** Recording interface demonstration upfront

### User Psychology Insights
- Extension users are efficiency-focused
- Want immediate proof the tool works
- Skeptical about new extensions (need visual evidence)
- Mobile research (31%) but desktop install behavior

## 📱 RESPONSIVE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

### Desktop (1200px+)
- Full split-screen layout
- Screenshot at 60% width

- Compressed content spacing

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Stack layout: Screenshot first, content below
- Full-width screenshot for impact
- Thumb-friendly CTA placement
- Minimal text content

- **Conversion Rate:** Hero CTA click-through to Chrome Web Store
- **Engagement:** Time spent on hero section
- **Decision Speed:** Reduce time to CTA click

### Secondary Metrics
- **Scroll Depth:** Monitor if more users stay in hero
- **Bounce Rate:** Should decrease with immediate visual proof
- **Mobile Performance:** Ensure mobile experience optimized

### A/B Testing Targets
- **15% increase** in Chrome Web Store clicks (conservative)
- **25% reduction** in bounce rate
- **47% improvement** based on extension screenshot research
